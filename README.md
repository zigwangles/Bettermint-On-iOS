## How to Set Up Bettermint

### Step 1: Get an Engine from Bettermint Sockets
1. Go to [Bettermint Sockets by Proton Dev](https://github.com/ProtonDev-sys/bettermint-sockets).
   
2. Scroll through the available engines and copy the configuration of the one you want to use. If your phone is slower or older, I recommend using engines that consume less RAM, like **Maia**.
